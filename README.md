# ID-Assignment-1
This project is on creating a personal portfolio for myself. In the website, it provides information about my personality, my achievements, and even skills to let recruiters know more about me upon viewing the website. The website is aimed at being user-friendly and interactive, allowing recruiters or users to have a smooth experience when viewing the website!

# Design process
This website is focused on recruiters or people that are interested in knowing more about me. Hence, i wanted the website to be somewhat simplistic to get straight to the point of providing information about me without looking too plain. As such, the website is simple in colour and design yet slightly interactive with the users to ensure a smooth experience when browsing through while providing some details about each achievement and skill displayed.

## USER STORY
As a recruiter looking for possible interns, they want to see what capabilities and history i have to get a good understanding of what i can do and have done before, this way they can better identify if i am suited to be recruited.

# Testing
## Testing process via senarios
1. HyperLink
   * Go to contact me page
   * Try to open the hyperlink in my socials section
   * See if the hyperlink links to the correct page
2. Contact form
   * Go to contact me page
   * Try to submit an empty form to verify that the fields must be filled
   * Try to submit the form with an invalid email without an @ to verify that the form requires a valid email
   * Try to submit the form with valid inputs and verify that a confirm message appears asking if you are ready to submit
   * Try and see if you are redirected to a thank you page
## How it should appear
Regardless of browsers as long as the screen width is sufficient to hold 4 boxes in a row, it will display the boxes in a row. However, when the screen width is insufficient, the boxes would go onto the next line

For screen sizes where the width is less than 576px, the navigation boxes at the very top shrinks to fit while the light green navigation boxes as well as images are each seperated by their own line. Furthermore, the size of the images are shrinked too to ensure that they are able to fit within the screen with a smaller width.

For screen sizes where the width is less than 750px, the navigation boxes at the very top and the light green navigation boxes shrink to fix within the width of the screen

For screen sizes where the width is more than 750px, the boxes and images remain the same size where the navigation boxes are all aligned into a row and images are aligned with 2 images in one row.

## Bugs/problems discovered
When the width shrinks, at a certain width when the light green boxes in the achievement page should be seperated individually instead of being group in one single row as seen in a desktop view, they are instead grouped with 2 boxes in a row instead of 1. It is only until it is shrunk further would the individual light green boxes be individually seperated.

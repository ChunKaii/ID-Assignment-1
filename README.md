# ID-Assignment-1
This project is on creating a personal portfolio for myself. In the website, it provides information about my personality, my achievements, and even skills to let recruiters know more about me upon viewing the website. The website is aimed at being user-friendly and interactive, allowing recruiters or users to have a smooth experience when viewing the website!

# Design process
This website is focused on recruiters or people that are interested in knowing more about me. Hence, i designed the website to be somewhat simplistic to get straight to the point of providing information about me without looking too plain. As such, the desired outcome of the website is to be simple yet slightly interactive with the users to ensure a smooth experience when browsing through.

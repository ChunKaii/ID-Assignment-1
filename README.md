# ID-Assignment-1
This project is on creating a personal portfolio for myself. In the website, it provides information about my personality, my achievements, and even skills to let recruiters know more about me upon viewing the website. The website is aimed at being user-friendly and interactive, allowing recruiters or users to have a smooth experience when viewing the website!

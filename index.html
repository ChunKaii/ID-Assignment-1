            <p class="big-box"> My name is Chun Kai and I am a year 1 student 
                studying the Information Technology Diploma in Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
                I've always believed that constant improvement is the key to 
                success. As such, I always bring forward an eager attitude when 
                learning. Furthermore, I am a strong believer that having a 
                tenacious attitude when facing challenges is indispensable, thus, 
                I never back down in the face of adversities. However, 
                improvement is not only derived from learning but also through 
                the effort we put in for the work we do. Hence, I am constantly
                diligent and meticulous with the work I produce.
